        "As software development has evolved, and it has become more and more critical to deliver solutions to the marketplace at a rapid pace, the traditional model has been replaced by [Agile processes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_agile_model.htm).\n",
        "\n",
        "With TDD, the tests are created prior to any code being written.  It seems odd because you might think \"How can you write a test for something that does not exist\".  Strangely enough, this is the exact point of TDD.\n",
